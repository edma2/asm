Welcome! You've reached Eugene's pet assembly projects.

So far these include
- mmcp.asm
        This is a memory mapping approach to copying files, rather than using the traditional Unix read/write interface.
        How it works: Open source file, create destination file. Map these files to a memory address using mmap(3P). Copy bytes from one address to another like one would with strings, except zero bytes don't terminate the string/file!
        Written in pure 32-bit x86 assembly using the Linux system call interface only (no glibc). Extremely unportable.
