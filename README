Welcome! You've reached Eugene's pet assembly projects.

mmcp: 
        A proof-of-concept for copying files using memory mappings rather than the traditional read and write system calls. 
        Similiar performance to GNU cp. Invoke mmcp -h for usage help.

        Features:
                - Written in pure 32-bit x86 assembly using the Linux system call interface only (no glibc). 
                - Extremely unportable
        Todo:
                - Use madvise for paging optimization, llseek for files larger than 2GB
                - use system call to get page size (?)
                - Do more performance testing
