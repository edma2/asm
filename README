Welcome! You've reached Eugene's pet assembly projects.

mmcp: A proof-of-concept for copying files using memory mappings rather than the traditional read and write system calls.
Description: Copy source file to destination path. Similiar performance to GNU cp.
        Features:
                - Written in pure 32-bit x86 assembly using the Linux system call interface only (no glibc). 
                - Extremely unportable
        Todo:
                - Do more performance testing
                - Allow for files larger than 2 GB.
