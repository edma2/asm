portscan
by Eugene Ma
===================
A port scanner that implements the TCP connect(2) scanning method using
multiple sockets in parallel to achieve fast scan rates (approximately 100
ports per second). Written entirely in 32-bit x86 assembly (NASM). 
portscan was written primarily for educational benefit, but may be fast, and is
at least comparable to nmap speeds.
